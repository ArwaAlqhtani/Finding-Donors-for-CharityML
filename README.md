# Finding-Donors-for-CharityML
 project 1 of Udacity nanodegree ( intro to machine learning with tensorflow)
 
In this project, supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause is applied.First the data is explored to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques have been applied to manipulate the data into a workable format.Then several supervised learners is implemented on the data, and considered which is best suited for the solution.

Afterwards, the model iâ€™ve selected is optimized and presented as solution to CharityML. Finally,the
